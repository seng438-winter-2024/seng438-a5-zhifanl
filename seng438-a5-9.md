# Introduction


This assignment introduced us to the process of using reliability assessment tools to evaluate integration test results, with a focus on the significance of maintaining system quality and dependability. We used two techniques for failure data assessment:

1. Reliability growth testing
2. Reliability assessment via the Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC)

These techniques are crucial for real-world applications because they offer insightful information about the dependability and efficacy of systems. This makes it possible for programmers to identify such problems early and take the necessary corrective action. By using these evaluation techniques, stakeholders may make well-informed judgments on the dependability of their systems and put policies in place to improve their lifespan and performance.

This lab's goal was to provide participants hands-on experience evaluating a hypothetical system's reliability by examining failure data gathered via integration testing. In order to accomplish this, the lab was split into two portions, each of which concentrated on a failure data assessment technique listed above.

We had to set up a reliability growth assessment tool (like SRTAT or CSFRAT) and create diagrams showing the failure rate and reliability of the system under test (SUT) in the first lab segment. In order to become acquainted with the functions and capabilities of a reliability growth testing tool, we decided to conduct our reliability growth testing using C-SRTAT.

The Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC) tool and its use were covered in the second section. Understanding how to plot the test data to determine the appropriateness of testing for a specific Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) of the SUT was one of the main objectives of this part.

We now have a better knowledge of dependability growth testing and its significance after completing this lab. The testing instruments utilized in the experiment, such as C-SFRAT or SRTAT, are described in this lab report. These tools were applied to the failure data set, which consists of a variety of test data files. For every failure data analysis approach, we chose one file.

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing

## test data used

According to the assignment requirements, we need to convert our selected input data into a compatible input file. We chose J5.DAT as our test data and convert the data into a xlsx file.

## Result of model comparison (selecting top two models)

We should take into account both the log-likelihood and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) when choosing the top two models from the comparison table. Higher values in the log-likelihood indicate a better fit between the model and the data. We additionally consider the AIC since models with more parameters have the potential to overfit the data. Models that obtain a good fit with fewer parameters are favored by the AIC, which modifies the log-likelihood to penalize for the number of parameters in the model.  The model with the lowest AIC is usually the most appropriate since it suggests the optimal trade-off between parsimony and goodness of fit. 'S' and 'DW3' are the best models according to these criteria since they have the lowest AIC values among the contenders, indicating that they are the most effective in explaining the data in an unnecessarily complex way.

## Result of range analysis (an explanation of which part of data is good for proceeding with the analysis)

We observed the failure count over the time intervals after analyzing the system's failure data that was gathered during integration testing. Although the data fluctuates a little, there isn't a clear trend of stabilization or a steady decline in the number of failures throughout the intervals. Our analysis of the failure data, which is displayed over several time intervals, shows a roughly linear pattern devoid of any discernible upward or decreasing trend. Proceeding with the observation, we have concluded that all the data should be taken into consideration given this observation and the lack of a distinct 'burn-in' impact or stabilizing phase that would indicate a mature system. This method captures the whole range of system behavior and failure events and enables a thorough evaluation of the system's reliability during the course of the testing phase.

## A discussion on decision making given a target failure rate

After utilizing the reliability evaluation tools to evaluate our system, we found that, after a period of 73 weeks, the total count of 367 failures is approximately 5 failures per week. Reducing this rate was our goal, and we set a more demanding target failure intensity of 3.00.

In order to estimate the system's dependability and failure severity over time, we carefully examined a number of models. We decided to concentrate on the DW3 and S models among them. In our analysis, we aimed to strike a balance between the prediction offered by the DW3 model and the S model, which is why we settled on a median value of 3.00 as our target. This value represents a point between the lowest predictions of the DW3 and S models and is therefore a realistic yet ambitious goal for system reliability.

This decision-making process acknowledges the current state of our system and leverages statistical modeling to set a feasible improvement target. As we progress, we will need to continue assessing the system against this benchmark, adjusting our development and testing efforts accordingly to ensure we meet our reliability objectives. The graph presented in the software tool helps visualize the trajectory towards meeting our target failure intensity and serves as a guide for our ongoing reliability enhancement strategies.

## A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of reliability growth analysis

# Assessment Using Reliability Demonstration Chart

## 3 Plots for MTTFMin, Twice and Half of It for Your Test Data
![method](https://github.com/seng438-winter-2024/seng438-a5-zhifanl/assets/64334331/91e616c1-794b-4119-b16e-958b0a2e76d4)

In the data drawn from Failure Report 8, we filled out sections of the Reliability-Demonstration-Chart spreadsheet to perform RDC testing. This dataset records 16 defects emerging over several days. We're adjusting the maximum threshold of tolerable defects per quantity of input events to scrutinize its impact on the Mean Time To Failure (MTTF).

<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://github.com/seng438-winter-2024/seng438-a5-zhifanl/assets/64334331/0ca95513-cadb-4582-acd2-e82676a9d163">

This analysis reveals a Fault Incidence Rate (FIR) of 4 defects every 43,200 seconds, equating to 4 defects per 12-hour period. It is noted that the MTTF, given a defect rate of 4 per 12 hours, is calculated to be 10,800 seconds, or 3 hours. Under these conditions, the graph remains in the “continue testing” zone until the occurrence of the 9th event, at which point it transitions into the “accept” category. Thus, the minimum MTTF is established at 3 hours.

<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://github.com/seng438-winter-2024/seng438-a5-zhifanl/assets/64334331/78ba234c-aa13-4c5a-b9c3-ba3e1883bf59">

Another observation indicates a FIR of 4 defects over 86,400 seconds, which corresponds to 4 defects every 24 hours. From this, it is evident that the MTTF at a defect rate of 4 per 24 hours reaches 21,600 seconds, or 6 hours. Given these metrics, the graph initially falls within the “continue testing” area but eventually moves into the “reject” territory. The MTTF of 6 hours represents twice the minimum MTTF. Increasing the MTTF heightens the minimum acceptance criteria, causing the graph to shift toward the “reject” region.

The final assessment shows a FIR of 4 defects every 21,600 seconds, translating to 4 defects every 6 hours.

<img width="468" alt="image" src="https://github.com/seng438-winter-2024/seng438-a5-zhifanl/assets/64334331/4824ab7c-b7ff-4640-b733-0b0226589a0a">

This finding shows that the MTTF, at a defect frequency of 4 per 6 hours, stands at 5,400 seconds, or 1.5 hours. Under these parameters, the chart begins in the “continue testing” area before rapidly entering the “accept” territory. The MTTF of 1.5 hours is half of the minimum MTTF. Lowering the MTTF reduces the minimum acceptance criteria, moving the chart into the “accept” region.

## Explain Your Evaluation and Justification of How You Decide The MTTFmin

Deailed evaluation and justification is provided above. The minimum Mean Time to Failure (MTTFmin) is based on a system's capability of handling certain failures, stress. It demonstrates the reliability of the system. After comparing and analyzing these three graphs, we made a conclusion that MTTFmin is ~2.9 hours. Which is the time when the line starts entering the accepting zone.

## Advantages of RDC

1. One of the primary advantages of the RDC is its ability to visually represent the reliability testing goals and outcomes. This makes it easier for engineers and decision-makers to understand the relationship between the test duration, the number of failures, and the reliability target.

2. The RDC supports decision-making by clearly showing whether the product meets the reliability requirements. If the data points fall within the acceptable area of the chart, the product is considered to have met its reliability goals.

3. The RDC is valuable both in the planning phase of reliability testing, to determine necessary sample sizes and test durations, and in the evaluation phase, to assess whether the reliability objectives have been achieved.

## Disadvantages of RDC

1. Complexity in Interpretation: For those unfamiliar with reliability engineering principles, interpreting the RDC can be challenging. It requires a solid understanding of reliability metrics and statistical methods.

2. Dependence on Accurate Assumptions: The effectiveness of an RDC is heavily dependent on the accuracy of the assumptions made regarding the underlying reliability model and the distribution of failure times. Incorrect assumptions can lead to misleading conclusions.

3. Sample Size Limitations: The RDC approach may require a relatively large sample size to demonstrate reliability, especially for highly reliable products. This can lead to higher costs and longer testing times.

4. Does Not Account for All Types of Data: The standard RDC may not be suitable for all types of reliability data, especially in cases where there are complex failure modes or when the data does not follow a common reliability distribution.

5. Potential for Over-Simplification: There's a risk that the simplicity of the visual representation might lead to over-simplification of complex reliability phenomena, potentially leading stakeholders to overlook important nuances.

6. In conclusion, while the RDC is a powerful tool for demonstrating and planning for product reliability, its effectiveness hinges on a proper understanding of its principles, careful planning, and accurate assumptions. It should be used as part of a comprehensive reliability engineering strategy that includes a thorough analysis of all relevant factors and potential limitations.

### Similarities:

- Both methodologies are deployed for assessing a system's reliability.
- Both require comprehensive data to yield precise outcomes.
- They both pinpoint components within the system that fall short in terms of reliability.
- They enable evaluators to ascertain whether the desired reliability threshold has been achieved.

### Differences:

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
Tasks were divided equally, and all of us contributed to the assignment. We had a group meeting and came up with a detailed plan before working on the assignment. Since this assignment has two parts, we decided Shanzi and Fardin would be responsible for part1, and Sandip Zhifan would handle part2. Finally, we collected our testing results and recorded them in the final report.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned


There are various tools for checking how reliable a system is, but they are just simulations and shouldn’t replace complete testing. These tools don't guarantee accuracy because a lot of their data is just estimated. Using these tools properly requires a deep understanding of how they work and how to interpret the results. Despite these challenges, learning about these tools is important because they are widely used in the industry, and knowing how to use them can be useful later on. We ran into a problem when the tool SRTAT didn’t work on our laptops. At first, it was hard to figure out how to get the results we needed for our assignment. But by sticking with it, referring to our lecture notes, and doing extra research, we managed to grasp the necessary concepts.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

To make lab sessions better, it's a good idea to use software that works on all types of computers. Also, giving clear instructions on how to use the tools can help us learn faster and waste less time figuring things out on our own. We spent tons of time understanding the requirements and setup. If we can have more time for the lab, we won't have to rush and will have a better chance to do our best work.
